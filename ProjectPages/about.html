        I'm John, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. Currently,
        I am in my fourth year, taking the semester to do a co-op at Flexcar.<br><br>

        Recently, I've been working with the QA team to develop a testing pipeline. This has included work within 
        the company's Java Springboot backend, developing RESTful API endpoints to send the internal system test data.
        Before that, I was working on frontend UI fixes and changes, along with backend feature implementation.
        <br><br>

        I have my projects listed on the previous page if you would like to look through them, along with
        my GitHub linked to see the code, and my resume on the bottom right.
