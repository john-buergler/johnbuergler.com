    <p>
        I'm John, a Data Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. Currently,
        I am in my third year, taking the semester to do a co-op at HCL America. At this co-op and in my courses over the years,
        I have been working to strengthen my programming ability to hopefully specialize in Data Science in the
        future. I have my skills and relevant courses listed on my resume, which you can access
        on the previous page.<br><br>
        I have my projects listed on the previous page if you would like to look through them, along with
        my GitHub linked to see the code.
