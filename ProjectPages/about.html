        I'm John! I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Computer Science and
        Mathematics. During my time at Northeastern, I completed two co-ops, one at HCL America and the
        other at Flexcar.<br><br>

        At Flexcar, I was a part of the risk and viability team. The majority of my work was in the backend, 
        focusing on a complete overhaul of our framework for evaluating customer eligibility. 
        I helped integrate third-party fraud-evaluation products into our codebase, and also reworked our end-to-end testing pipeline to account for
        the updated checkout flow. Before that, at HCL SoFy, I integrated user data event tracking directly
        into our codebase, and then from that data generated analytics dashboards to provide the UI/UX team
        actionable insights.
        <br><br>

        I have my projects listed on the previous page if you would like to look through them, along with
        my GitHub linked to see the code, and my resume on the bottom right.
