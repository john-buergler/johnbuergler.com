        I'm John, a Data Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. Currently,
        I am in my third year, taking the semester to do a co-op at HCL America. During this co-op,
        I have been working with a small team to develop data analytics on sandbox usage<br><br>

        This has included the creation and implementation of a data library that tracks information
        about our cloud-based sandboxes. Using this library, we have developed visualizations and insights
        to cut costs on idle cloud spending.<br><br>

        In my classes, I have studied a wider range of skills, including programming projects that developed
        my skills in areas like object-oriented programming and machine learning.<br><br>

        I have my projects listed on the previous page if you would like to look through them, along with
        my GitHub linked to see the code, and my resume on the bottom right.
