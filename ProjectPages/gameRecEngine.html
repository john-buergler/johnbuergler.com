    This project is a game recommendation engine for the Steam platform, which
    used machine learning and data pipelines to provide the user a top 10 list of recommended games.<br><br>
<div style="font-size: 15px">
    Here are your recommended games:<br>
    Talvisota - Winter War<br>
    Fun with Ragdolls: The Game<br>
    Battlevoid: Harbinger<br>
    GemCraft - Chasing Shadows<br>
    Ashes of Creation Apocalypse<br>
    Steel Circus<br>
    Mass Effectâ„¢: Andromeda Deluxe Edition<br>
    Alien Rage - Unlimited<br>
    GUILTY GEAR XX ACCENT CORE PLUS R<br>
    Borderlands Game of the Year Enhanced<br>
</div>
    <br>In order to do this, we used two open-source databases called SteamSpy API and the official Steam web API
    in order to gather data about the user and the games that we would be working with. The approach that we decided
    to take was a K-Means clustering approach based on the tags and genres of the games provided.

    To do this, we used the Scikit Learn machine learning library along with pandas databases in order to engineer and
    develop and process the data that we were going to use.<br><br>
    This project most importantly taught me the many considerations to take into account when training a machine learning model.
