    Diversify Your Taste is a personal project that is currently a work in progress.<br><br>
    The idea stemmed from my realization that the recommendation engines that dominate streaming services
    today focus solely on distributing what is popular, whether it is overall popularity, or popularity within a
    specific subgroup. As an avid user of music streaming services, I found that people who like to explore
    something new are somewhat left out in the algorithm. Diversify Your Taste is an attempt to break that, with
    the simple idea of the:<br><br>
    <b>e-factor</b> (Or experimentation-factor)<br><br>
    The goal is to take into account the likelihood of someone to experiment with music outside their favorite genre,
    to recommend music that may have similar qualities, but often fit a different group of people.<br><br>
    A person's e-factor is gathered from their spotify streaming data: their top songs, top genres, and recently listened.
    This data is used to show the range of their taste, which will then determine how diverse their selections are.
    For those who don't necessarily try much music outside their comfort zone, it will take that into account to make sure
    that they still enjoy what they hear.<br><br>
    This project has the potentials to not only help listeners enjoy more music and expand their understanding of
    different genres, but it will also grow the fan bases of artists who may not be favored by the algorithm.<br><br>
